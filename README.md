    <h1>Israel And Palestine</h1>
    <h2>the country of two countries</h2>
    <P>Once in a village that is burning
      because a village is always somewhere burning <br>

And if you do not look because it is not your village<br>
      it is still your village <br>

In that village is a hollow child
      You drown when he looks at you with his black, black<br> eyes <br>

And if you do not cry because he is not your child<br>
      he is still your child <br>

All the animals that could run away have run away<br>
      The trapped ones make an orchestra of their hunger<br> 

The houses are ruin      Nothing grows in the garden<br>
      The grandfather’s grave is there      A small stone<br> 

under the shade of a charred oak      Who will brush off the<br> dead<br>
      leaves      Who will call his name for morning prayer<br> </p>
    </body>
